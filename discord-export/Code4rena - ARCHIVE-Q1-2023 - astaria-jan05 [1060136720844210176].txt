The link in the Spearbit related issues in the public repo are private. Not really clear what they entail (some less so than others).
Have those issues been resolved in the current code (as they all seem to date from 30 Nov).

{Reactions}
✅ 

[01/06/2023 10:11] androolloyd
Yes, they have been resolved, there were some informational changes that were ignored due to changes in the code from post spearbit additions(multi token, upgrability, and seaport updates)

Spearbit has not yet delivered their compiled report so the repo is still marked private afaik.

@androolloyd should Vault accept any ERC20?


[01/06/2023 11:54] delvir0
@androolloyd 2 and 6 months is a mistake or am I reading it incorrectly?

[01/06/2023 15:01] c7e7eff
As strategists are whitelisted does that mean that for the purpose of this contest they should be regarded as trusted accounts ? (i.e. no evil strategist)


[01/06/2023 15:31] androolloyd
they are UI whitlisted, there is nothing in the protocol but yes, evil strategists are assumed a possibility, but how the protocol works has no concept of a whitelist.


[01/06/2023 15:31] androolloyd
in our case we have arrangements with strategists that we will market on the app(any public vault that is deployed by an approved strategist will be visible in the UI, others will not)


[01/06/2023 16:03] santiagogregory
yes, both of those should say 6 months. good catch, sorry about that


[01/06/2023 16:11] santiagogregory
you should assume strategists can write whatever loan terms they want (which could be very unfair), but they obviously shouldnt just be able to drain user funds from a vault without issuing valid terms

{Reactions}
👍 

[01/06/2023 17:41] androolloyd
you can deploy a vault with any ERC20 yes.


[01/06/2023 17:41] androolloyd
however a vault can only accept the ERC20 it's been deployed with.


[01/07/2023 07:28] stermi
Hi there, is there an infographic that show how actors and contracts interact each other with?


[01/07/2023 09:10] androolloyd
Hi, I don’t think we have an actor diagram. 

The Router is what most people will interact with, however vaults are designed to be interact-able directly, so that utilizing the router isn’t needed or if others wanted to compose the vaults directly into their contracts


[01/07/2023 17:46] ladboy233

[01/08/2023 10:36] viraz4331
@androolloyd 
was going through the docs, do the loan terms also specify the nft address the loan is valid for ?


[01/08/2023 12:36] androolloyd
yes, there are collection terms and unique terms both specify the contract address of the nft, collection terms have no id.


[01/08/2023 17:08] viraz4331
the missing natspec in functions etc is not very helpful 😅

Yes. Essentially a whole new protocol

There is almost no onchain state now. Liquidation flow is all different. New permission flows. Multi token. Fully upgradable.

@androolloyd 
need context regarding this `nlrDetails: params.validatorDetails` what is a validator in this case since based on the docs I was only aware of 3 actors


[01/09/2023 07:16] androolloyd
A validator is a smart contract that validates the nlr details data , we call them strategy validators. There are 3 in the repo. Unique. Collection. Univ3.


[01/09/2023 08:52] delvir0
@androolloyd where exactly is a public or private vault initiated/ created?


[01/09/2023 08:56] androolloyd
The router


[01/09/2023 10:46] 0kage
@androolloyd when can LPs withdraw assets for which they raise withdraw requests in the current epoch - is it at the start of the next epoch or at the end of next epoch?


[01/09/2023 11:24] santiagogregory
by the end of the next epoch


[01/09/2023 11:24] androolloyd
If you signal in epoch 0, you can withdraw at the end of epoch 1. Which is actually the start of epoch 2


[01/09/2023 11:24] androolloyd
Once process epoch has been called, the boundary has been passed and you can withdraw.


[01/09/2023 11:25] santiagogregory
sorry about the inconvenient formatting, natspec for public fns are still in interfaces


[01/09/2023 12:25] c7e7eff
What is the range of  epoch timespan deemed reasonable ?


[01/09/2023 13:20] androolloyd
the epochs are defined at the vault level when a strategist deploys them


[01/09/2023 13:20] androolloyd
default protocol values enforce epochs being at min 7 days, at most 45

[01/09/2023 18:10] trustminimised
regarding this, the docs say 
> [...] and whitelisted strategists can deploy PublicVaults that accept funds from other liquidity providers. (PublicVault whitelists are only enforced at the UI level.)
Just for clarity, it's the strategists that are whitelisted (just in the UI) and not PublicVault contracts?


[01/09/2023 19:26] androolloyd
correct anyone can deploy a public vault, we just wont show public vaults in the ui for non approved strategists.


[01/09/2023 19:26] androolloyd
the UI will however load them if you enter the address of the vault directly into the url


[01/09/2023 19:26] androolloyd
like uniswap tokens

i think you are supposed to fork the mainnet as there are other contracts that you need to interact with like seaport

[01/10/2023 03:08] atlanticbase
Hi, is there any docs on the `file*` functions that are implemented in `AstariaRouter.sol`? Thanks


[01/10/2023 07:30] Oishun#3920
What's the motivation of using merkle proof when issuing Lien?


[01/10/2023 09:22] saksham#7993
Any preferred starting point from where to start , docs are pretty clear but don't know which contract to pick first


[01/10/2023 13:52] koolexc
Hi, I have a question.
> If a Vault offers better loan terms for the same collateral a borrower has deposited, their loan may be permissionlessly refinanced. See Refinancing for more information

Is this valid for both public and private Vaults?


[01/10/2023 14:09] santiagogregory
they are identical to the file functions in collateraltoken, lientoken, etc. is there anything specific you were confused about?


[01/10/2023 14:11] santiagogregory
a Stack is a single lien/loan, and it is broken up into Lien struct data and Point struct data


[01/10/2023 14:11] santiagogregory
Lien struct data doesnt change throughout the loan lifecycle (things like collateral type, and Details which includes interest rate)


[01/10/2023 14:12] santiagogregory
Point data changes whenever a payment is made against the lien: this would update "last" to the timestamp of the payment, and subtract the payment amount from "amount"


[01/10/2023 14:12] santiagogregory
just makes it so we dont have to access storage more than we have to


[01/10/2023 14:12] santiagogregory
yes, refinancing is done through LienToken, so the logic would be same whether a publicvault or privatevault holds a lientoken


[01/10/2023 14:13] santiagogregory
so someone could refinance a lien from a privatevault to a publicvault, and vice versa


[01/10/2023 14:13] koolexc
Got it. Thank you


[01/10/2023 14:28] atlanticbase
I’m confused on the use case of the file functions. How they are used and for what


[01/10/2023 14:28] santiagogregory
theyre used to set protocol constants


[01/10/2023 14:28] santiagogregory
fees, minimum increases and decreases for refinancing, etc


[01/10/2023 14:29] santiagogregory
so the intended use case is that theyll be used infrequently by protocol maintainers (us at astaria for now)

@ColorCoded13 I guess I'd call this "the file pattern." It's a way to set storage variables without writing a separate, repetitive setter function for each one. The Maker contracts first called it "file": https://t.co/q52h0HOl25

The example above is from @AstariaXYZ.

[01/10/2023 15:00] 0xnogo
Can anyone explain the slope/yIntercept concepts in WithdrawProxy and Public Vault?


[01/10/2023 15:10] 0xnogo
yIntercept = amount present in the vault?


[01/10/2023 15:10] 0xnogo
slope = the interest rate?


[01/10/2023 15:54] santiagogregory
not exactly


[01/10/2023 15:54] santiagogregory
basically, the vault has an "implied value" which is what the vault would have in real assets (WETH, for example) if every loan was being linearly repaid


[01/10/2023 15:55] santiagogregory
for example, if the vault has 10 WETH, and a 4 WETH loan thats 50% done, that implied value of the vault is 12 WETH (note that this implied value isnt tracked internally)


[01/10/2023 15:55] santiagogregory
so here your slope would be however many weth/second that loan is accruing


[01/10/2023 15:56] santiagogregory
the publicvault tracks a "last" timestamp which is the last timestamp any loan was repaid, a liquidation happened, or any other state change was made (for example a processEpoch())


[01/10/2023 15:56] santiagogregory
the implied value of the vault is yIntercept + slope * (block.timestamp-last)


[01/10/2023 15:56] santiagogregory
this is how we compute how much LPs should be owed, without having to do an actual state change where we recompute how much interest has been accrued against every active loan


[01/10/2023 15:56] santiagogregory
we essentially move the gas cost to the stage change to whenever a loan repayment or liquidation is made

From the docs, does this mean if the loan is paid off ? just to confirm it is just a typo or maybe I am misunderstanding the concept
> When a lien is fully paid off, its LienToken is burned

yes haha, a lien basically == loan

[01/10/2023 18:47] santiagogregory
not a typo, just a term used to denote debt against an asset (like a house), could replace with loan

withdrawReserve is the amount of assets owed to withdrawing LPs during the current epoch

if its 0, that means all the funds owed to them have been transferred to the withdrawproxy for that epoch

[01/11/2023 06:38] androolloyd
They get verified as clones and minimal proxies but in our case our clones are clones of a beacon proxy so the implementation doesn’t map on etherscan

Non public vaults you deposit into directly. As they are only able to be funded by strategists.


[01/11/2023 06:40] androolloyd
Public vaults, it’s best to use the router as it has slippage shielding. But it’s not required.

I think the issues have been addressed. If you check the code4arena repo vs the report you can see that those issues don’t exist anymore. But let’s hear from them to be sure


[01/11/2023 17:25] justinbram
Yes all issues have been addressed

Except for a small minority of informationals

Bruh, Im new and I may be slightly stupid but... To compile a contract within Hardhat, do I need specific scripts for the specified contract? idk if this question makes sense or not


[01/11/2023 18:27] trustminimised
This project is using foundry and not hardhat. Are you trying to use hardhat anyway?


[01/11/2023 18:27] acegawd
@santiagogregory DM


[01/11/2023 18:28] fundra1s3r
that makes perfect sense. I am using Hardhat


[01/11/2023 18:28] fundra1s3r
should I make the switch to foundry ?


[01/11/2023 18:29] trustminimised
I think foundry is much much better than hardhat, but that's just my opinion.
If you want to be productive in this specific contest, use the framework the project is using. They include commands at the end of the contest readme to get you set up.

    uint256 increaseYIntercept;

[01/12/2023 10:54] androolloyd
If you look at what’s happening on the other side of the call, it’s pretty clear, but lienslope is the slope of the lien being bought out at the current moment, lienEnd is the end of the liens point. And the increaseYIntercept is the change to be applied to the vaults yIntercept.

out of curiosity what was the rationale for choosing the storage method for contracts? (loading slots vs inheriting storage contracts)


[01/14/2023 08:24] captainwoof.official
Gas savings


[01/14/2023 09:07] captainwoof.official
How does a borrower takes loans? What's the flow? Please correct me if I am wrong:

1. Borrower transfers NFT to `CollateralToken` contract, and gets minted a Collateral token
2. Borrower calls `commitToLien()` in a vault (`VaultImplementation`), gets minted a `LienToken`, and then receives assets on loan


[01/14/2023 14:29] androolloyd
also everything is a proxy and perfectly upgradable if we do slots.

Need a suggestion

I see that certain system contracts import ERC721. Problem is, I need to test AstariaRouter, and importing the system contracts cause a name collision for at least ERC721.

How to proceed, without manually changing names?


[01/15/2023 08:41] androolloyd
You can rename imports, using the import as designation.


[01/15/2023 08:41] androolloyd
https://solidity-by-example.org/import/


[01/15/2023 08:42] androolloyd
import {ERC721 as Bob} from …


[01/15/2023 08:43] androolloyd
If you’re trying to import the router and are just importing the full file you’re declaring into the file scope all dependencies for the contract vs just importing the contract


[01/15/2023 08:43] androolloyd
Import {AstariaRouter} from vs import “AstariaRouter.sol”


[01/15/2023 08:43] androolloyd
Hope that helps

Hi, all. We've had some discussions and this PR in the Astaria repo: https://github.com/AstariaXYZ/astaria-core/pull/303 The Astaria team has been informed about the unfortunate impact this has on the contest. **In the interest of fairness, any findings addressed by the pull request will be eligible only up to the timestamp of the PR. **

I'm very sorry this happened. We will continue to work to better educate sponsor dev teams on how violating the code-freeze mid-audit breaks the C4 model.

For clarity, was this PR made in response to a finding submitted by a warden? Or did they just find the issue on their own and patched it?

I don't know firsthand, so I'll let them speak to it but my impression is a discussion with a warden may have informed a change they made.

Hey everyone. We fucked up here, we had a dev hacking on a whole diff problem around buyout, which resulted in a change around how it would work if we wanted to go that way, and in the effort of trying to move fast and break things, we’ll it’s clear we broke things in the wrong way.


[01/17/2023 20:46] androolloyd
Y’all have been so great along the way, and it’s sucks we put a bad taste in everyone’s mouth as a result of this change, it truly wasn’t intended , we got over zealous and we’re just looking to better chat about the change Santiago made as it’s hard to talk about without a change set of what that would be. 

The conversations were started due to a report but it wasn’t the report that triggered the work but rather the report was also encompassed in the changes. 

I am very sorry this happened and to any wardens impacted, those with any findings already submitted around buyout lien, please DM me so I have a record of who we scorned and can work to make it up to you somehow. 

Sincerely sorry this happened and it’s egg on our faces that will take a bit to wash off.

sending you a DM regarding a question


[01/18/2023 17:06] josephdelong
Y'all this was my fault. One of our devs was making a fix to a portion of the codebase that was highlighted by a warden. The fix was unrelated to the wardens message but made us take a closer look at that portion of the codebase.
One of our developers asked me specifically to create a private repo to apply the fix he was working on. I declined the request thinking all submissions had already been made and that we were in the reporting phase.

We don't yet know the scope of those effected. I am sorry and want to take full responsibility for the mistake. When we understand the full scope of those effected we will take steps to make those individuals whole.

validate the strategy chosen by the borrower


[01/19/2023 14:12] androolloyd
It validates the nlrDetails field. Which is bytes encoded data most of the time it’s just an Abi encoded struct but the idea is that strategy validators can be added to the protocol after deployment. 

These validators allow the protocol to add new emerging types of collateral and can query any on chain data sets needed. If you look at the uniswap v3 one as an example.

[02/24/2023 03:35] xyzbtchunt
Is the judging still being done?


[02/24/2023 06:38] pfapostol
Just because you spam every day doesn't make judging faster. Please be respectful of other wardens who use the channel for professional purposes.

He is  expectant and excited 😅


[02/24/2023 12:52] pfapostol
Nobody forbids being excited. But when someone will ask a relevant question, no one will answer because everyone mute the channel due to spam.

It took me one full day to make one report for this contest with PoC and everything, couldn't imagine how many work judges need to do

I swear the more time I spend on the contest, the less I get 🤷‍♂️


[03/03/2023 02:02] birdy0219
Probably didn't help that the code base change effected one of my findings and the team didn't get back to me :Sad_Squidward_Pepe:
